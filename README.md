# Spotify End-To-End Data Engineering Project

### Introduction
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data pipeline that extracts data from the Spotify API, processes it with AWS Glue and Apache Spark, stores it in Snowflake, and visualizes it in Power BI. The entire workflow is orchestrated using Apache Airflow running on Docker.
